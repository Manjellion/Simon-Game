# Simon-Game
HTML, CSS, JS(jQuery)

Mainly created to develop my JavaScript skills with using the JS libary jQuery
This web app game is a memory sequence game where you press the colour that flashes and must remeber, if you dont then you loose and have to restart

Used JS methods like Event handlers, updating, resseting comparing array's using JS, used JS mainly in the form of jQuery as it was pratice to see and maintain that set of skills.
